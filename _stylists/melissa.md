Melissa Cable, a Northeast Native, is a visual hairstylist that specializes in cutting, styling and Stitch Extensions. Her philosophy as an artist is to work with each guestâ€™s personal style to create a look best fit for them.

Melissa began her career at the Minneapolis Aveda Institute in 2003. Since then she has been on a quest for hair knowledge and has attended a variety of intensive training programs in Minnesota, Chicago and New York.

Stitch Extensions are a traditional sewing method that give maximum fullness without any glues or adhesives. Using this method for 17 years has given her the experience to create natural looking styles that are easy to maintain at home. You can see before and after photos at:

Meg graduated from Aveda in 2007 and has worked in a few salons in the Twin Cities since then. She has explored a few avenues of the industry, including extensions and wigs, while still working behind the chair. She continues to take classes on cut and color techniques.

“I really like so many aspects of doing hair. My favorite is probably color, but I love taking people through the process beginning to end, color and cut. I also love helping people to look and feel their best.”

Laura has had three years training, mainly with the Deva methods, and is a great fan of their line of products. She had the opportunity to take Deva’s 3 day advanced course in New York City in 2012, which gave her a greater understanding of all kinds of textures. Although her focus has been mainly toward working with curly hair, she welcomes all hair types to her chair.

“There are no rights or wrongs when it comes to your hair and I like to help my clients figure out what works best for their hair type and lifestyle.”

I enjoy being a stylist who can help find the colors and cuts for individual expression. I like to work with people who want to get away from a high maintenance color schedule, and find beautiful ways to blend or work with graying hair. I have a similar approach to hair cuts, in that I do a majority of shaping dry, as a way to use natural textures for style.

Being an owner at Wildflower feels exciting to me because I get to work with abolutely lovely and inspiring people, using products that are the healthiest we can find.

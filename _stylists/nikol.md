blurb: Nikol started at Salon Stella in 2008. Her specialty is event styles and makeup, but she loves the variety that comes in daily.
---
After graduating from Aveda in 2001, she salon hopped for a few years before beginning work as an apprentice in a large salon. Over the years Nikol has done a fair amount of work on photo shoots, events, and weddings.

She enjoys working at Salon Stella because she finds her coworkers and clients to be interesting and authentic. “They are a fascinating blend who come from all over the state.”  She’s also done hair and makeup for a model from America’s Next Top Model.

Nikol’s hair tip is one she learned from a client. “Put a few drops of rosemary oil on your scalp to promote hair growth. It also helps clear your mind and energize.”

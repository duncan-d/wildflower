Becca has been in the industry since 2007. During her career, she has spent numerous years traveling the country seeking advanced education in her craft. She in turn brought that knowledge back to her own salon to educate her staff. After several years of salon ownership, she desired a more easy paced work-load, and ventured off to work independently. She has since found a home at Wildflower Salon, where she could continue to embrace the art curly hair, as well as using clean and natural products.
